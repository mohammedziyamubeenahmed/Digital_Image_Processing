Develop a program to achieve the following functions:
• A GUI to allow user interactions for loading images, specifying operations and arguments, and visualizing the outputs,
• Loading one image and extracting the edge features of the object (make sure the edges
  form a closed boundary. Morphology operators may be used);
• Extracting the edge points and creating Fourier descriptor from the point set;
• Allowing the user to specify the percentage of Fourier coefficients to be retained for reconstruction;
• Reconstructing an object boundary from the retained Fourier coefficients and visualizing the reconstruction;
• Allowing the user to save the Fourier descriptor.
